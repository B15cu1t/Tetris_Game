# Tetris Game  
**Python / Pygame Educational Project**

---

## Overview
This project is a fully functional **Tetris game** developed in **Python using the Pygame library**.  
It was created as a learning project to strengthen understanding of **game loops, object-oriented programming, collision detection, and real-time user input handling**.

The game closely follows classic Tetris mechanics while adding modern features such as sound effects, level progression, and a next-piece preview.

---

## Project Description
The game implements all core Tetris mechanics:
- Falling tetrominoes with rotation
- Collision detection with walls and placed blocks
- Line clearing and score calculation
- Increasing difficulty through level progression
- Game-over detection and restart functionality

The game runs in a graphical window using Pygame and is controlled entirely via the keyboard.  
Sound effects and background music are included to enhance the gameplay experience.

## Features
- Classic Tetris gameplay mechanics  
- Multiple tetromino shapes with correct rotations  
- Real-time collision detection  
- Line clearing with score calculation  
- Level-based speed progression  
- Next piece preview  
- Sound effects (rotate, drop, line clear, game over)  
- Background music with mute toggle  
- Game over screen with restart option  

---

## Controls
- **Left Arrow** – Move piece left  
- **Right Arrow** – Move piece right  
- **Up Arrow** – Rotate piece  
- **Down Arrow** – Soft drop  
- **Space** – Hard drop  
- **ESC** – Restart game  
- **M** – Toggle background music  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pygame** – Rendering, input handling, audio  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- **Randomization** – Piece generation  
- **Basic audio handling** via `pygame.mixer`

## Educational Goals
Through this project, I learned:
- How real-time game loops work
- Collision detection in grid-based games
- Managing game state (start, running, game over)
- Object-oriented design for game entities
- Keyboard input handling and event-driven programming
- Basic audio integration in games

This project significantly improved my confidence in building interactive applications with Python.

## Future Improvements
Possible enhancements include:
- Hold piece functionality
- Scoring system closer to official Tetris rules
- Pause menu
- Custom themes and visuals
- Improved animations and transitions
